# Shifter
Shifter is a gameplay modification for [Deus Ex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex_(video_game)) made by **yukichigai**

This repository unpatches the pause lockpick/multitool glitch, so now you can use 1 of each item to unlock/hack anything regardless of its difficulty. Isn't that fun?
